## FAQ

**Which audit automation software works best for external auditors?**

DataSnipper excels for external auditors because it integrates directly into Excel where audit work already happens, handling document extraction, cross-referencing, and validation without learning new software. CaseWare IDEA provides powerful data analytics with 100+ pre-built tests for analyzing complete datasets. Both platforms support tests of details, controls testing, and financial statement procedures efficiently.

**Can these platforms handle both internal and external audit requirements?**

Several platforms support both audit types effectively. Workiva, AuditBoard, and Diligent HighBond handle internal audit planning, execution, and reporting while also facilitating external audit collaboration. DataSnipper works for internal audit teams performing operational testing and SOX controls documentation in addition to external statutory audits. The key difference is internal audit platforms emphasize risk management integration while external audit tools focus on evidence documentation and testing procedures.

**How do AI-powered audit tools differ from traditional audit software?**

AI-powered platforms like MindBridge and DataSnipper analyze patterns and anomalies across entire datasets rather than using rule-based sampling. They continuously learn from transaction data to identify risks that static rules miss, including sophisticated fraud schemes and management overrides. Traditional software requires manual configuration of tests and analyses fixed criteria. AI tools adapt to new patterns automatically, providing faster risk detection and reducing false positives through machine learning.
